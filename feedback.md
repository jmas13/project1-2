### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)? ___0: Does not meet expectations___

  * A **hosted copy of your game or app, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages

    _You didn't host the app on GitHub pages. Did you have trouble with that or not know you were meant to?_

  * Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    _Got two errors back from the HTML validator and three from the CSS_

  * A **git repository hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project

    _Good job here. Looks like you followed a good workflow_

  * A **link to your hosted project** in the URL section of your Github repo

    _See above_

  * **A ``readme.md`` file**, including
    * Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

      _Really good job explaining approach but lacking in explanation of technologies, installation instructions, and unsolved problems_

    * At least 5 [user stories](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/02-intermediate-front-end/process-stories-wireframes).

      _None included. Could you rewrite your steps as user stories?_


* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex? ___1 Meets expectations___

  Your app must:

  * **Render in the browser** :+1:
  * **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files** :+1:
  * Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles :+1:
  * Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** :+1:
  * **Deploy online**, using [Github **Project** pages](https://pages.github.com). :-1:
  * Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices) :-1:

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class? ___1 Meets expectactions___

  _Nice job packaging code up into objects and writing functions with particular utility (one job one function). See comments in code_

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? ___1 Meets expectations___

  _The comments for the most part do a good job explaining the reasoning behind parts of your app. Some comments were out of place or look residual from earlier plans._

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
**2** | _Exceeds expectations_

___1 Meets expectactions___ Overall nice job. Could have put a little more work into the details especially making sure your code validates.

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
